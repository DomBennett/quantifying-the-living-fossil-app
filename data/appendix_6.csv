Appendix 6. Information and statistics for all clades for which pEPI, EPI and ED scores were calculated. Clades are ordered by pEPI. Common names are not available for all clades, these are automatically taken from NCBI. If you are looking for a specific clade, you may not find it because we only calculate values for clades that split. For example, lungfishes are represented by the clade ""Ceratodontimorpha"" even though they are more commonly known as ""Dipnoi"". This is because, according to NCBI taxonomy, the Dipnoi group only has a single child, Ceratodonitmorpha, which from the perspective of evolutionary performance make them the same clade. To find a clade, first search for it at the NCBI taxonomy website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) to ensure it is splitting. Additionally, many clades were ommitted if their ""Success"" was greater than 0.01 and/or their parent had fewer than 500 descendent species.
